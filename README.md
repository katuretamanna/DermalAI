Title: Dermal AI: Deep Learning Approach for Pre Detection and Classification of Skin Lesions
Problem: Skin cancer is increasingly prevalent due to environmental changes and lifestyle factors. It poses significant health risks, including tissue damage and mortality. Despite effective traditional diagnostic methods, early detection remains crucial. Hence, there's a pressing need to explore innovative approaches for timely detection and management.
Methodology: Our study focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and EfficientNet B3, for skin cancer detection. We utilize a dataset comprising 3,299 training images and 660 test images categorized into benign and malignant samples. Through rigorous evaluation, we assess the performance of these models in accurately classifying skin lesions.
Results: Our findings highlight the efficacy of AI models in skin cancer classification. EfficientNet B3 demonstrates superior performance with 88% training accuracy and 86% validation accuracy, outperforming the CNN model. These results underscore the potential of AI in enhancing early detection. Furthermore, the development of an intelligent web portal facilitates real-world deployment, promising advancements in skin cancer diagnosis.
